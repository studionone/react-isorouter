# react-isorouter

This is an HTML5 `window.history` based router component for React 0.13, written in ECMAScript 2015 (also known as ES6) with full support for isomorphic rendering.

## Documentation

This README will get you up and running quickly, but for more comprehensive usage documentation head to our [documentation site](http://studionone.github.io/react-isorouter).

## Requirements

This library expects a couple of things for basic usage, the main one being some `require()` implementation for CommonJS module loading. We personally use [Browserify](http://browserify.org), but [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io) will work nicely too. This library does not require ES6 to use, only to work on the source; the devDependencies should cover everything you need to hack on the (rather tiny) core.
